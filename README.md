This is my first portfolio site, used for practising full stack while I was learning express, react and mongodb etc.
I am currently building a new portfolio site without a back end.

I built this because I wanted to set up a full stak app from scratch for myself, without tutorials boilerplates etc.
The front end is built with react.
It consists of one home page, divided into sections. These sections have their own nav links and appear to be independent pages, untill you start scrolling.
The content shows me as a person, what I have done so far and some links to code.
The other page is a little blog with some reminders for myself of my learning journey. 
It is served with Express and data is stored in Mongo atlas.
It uses Userfront for authorization, although I have added a login for everybody to use (so you don't have to go through the process of siging up).
I added a bit scss later, to practice with it. 
It still needs a solid error boundary, something I am keen on learning soon.

I have used netlify for the front end:

And heroku for the back end (heroku puts apps to sleep so sometimes it takes time to load..)
