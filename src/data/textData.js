I aborted this after two years, because of personal reasons.  Whilst at university I worked as a shift manager in a large restaurant.  When I aborted my degree I started working here full time, mainly to have some time to think about what to do next.",

I completed my Hospitality Management whilst working as an assistant manager in charge of around 45 staff.  Due to changes at the directors level of this restaurant chain and following disagreements, I decided to give up this role and to travel around for some time.  I ended up in Spain (2001) and coincidentally ended up at a restaurant who needed an assitant manager.  After this season the owners offered me to set up a new site with them.  This included a large seaside restaurant, a small nightclub and bar in town.  I managed these sites very successfull for 5 years.  Duties included everything from accounts, to staff management of around 60 people, to organising events and much more.",

After a season running a restaurant in Les Deux Alpes (France), I decided to get certified in ski and snowboard instructing and than got a job in Turoa, New Zealand.  I spent a season in the snow, instructing and completing various courses in order to teach more advanced skiers/snowboarders.  After that season I got a job in Konigsleiten (Austria), where I carried on working as an instructor/guide.  This is where I met my wife, who was also working in this skischool.   I have done this for 5 seasons in total.",

        text: "My wife is a farmers daughter and in 2009 we spent 8 months together in New Zealand, working on various farms/smallholdings through a program called Helpx(work for food/accomodation).  I got very interested in farming and especially sustainable beef farming.  When we got the chance to manage a farm in France for a few years, I got more and more interested in this subject.  The farm in France belonged to an old family friend, who was 'let down' by her previous manager and was hoping to sell the farm.  This was during the financial crisis and we managed the farm for three years, whilst dealing with many potential buyers. After three years we succeeded in selling the farm.  We moved to the UK (2012), to be closer to my wife's family.  There I found a job as a herdsman on a grass fed beef farm, where I was managing a large herd which included anything to do with cows/calves, finishing cows, all the tractor work, etc.  I worked here for 3.5 years, trying to get as much experience as possible to hopefully start for myself.  We tried to obtain several farm tenancies, but all failed unfortunately.   As I am not a person who could be a farm worker for his entire life, I decided to stop working there.",

I got more and more into stock trading, which had always been a hobby of mine.  When we got back in the UK, I decided to carry on doing that.  The only problem was that the more I did it, the more I disliked it.  It is a lot of waiting for certain levels to be hit before doing anything and doing it full-time was getting a bit boring.  So I started to help out an old friend who is a plumber/electrician, but carrying on trading on the side.  Enjoying this I then started doing projects for myself.  Over the past few years I have done several bathrooms, kitchens, patios and driveways.  I really enjoy the creative and problem solving side of it and I get to learn new skills on the job all the time.",
