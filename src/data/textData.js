I ended up in Spain (2001) and coincidentally ended up at a restaurant who needed an assitant manager. I did that for a summer and than the owners offered me to set up a new site with them. This included a large seaside restaurant, a small nightclub and bar in town. I managed these sites very successfull for 5 years.

I got very interested in farming and especially sustainable beef farming. When we got the chance to manage a farm in France for a few years, I got more and more interested in this subject. The farm in France belonged to an old family friend, who was 'let down' by her previous manager and was hoping to sell the farm. This was during the financial crisis and we managed the farm for three years, whilst dealing with many potential buyers. After three years we succeeded in selling the farm. We moved to the UK (2012), to be closer to my wife's family. There I found a job as a herdsman on a grass fed beef farm, where I was managing a large herd which included anything to do with cows/calves, finishing cows, all the tractor work, etc. I worked here for 3.5 years, trying to get as much experience as possible to hopefully start for myself. I tried to obtain several farm tenancies, but all failed unfortunately. I was also hoping to take over the management of the farm where I was working, but that was not possible. As I am not a person who could be a farm worker for his entire life, I decided to stop working there.",

The only problem was that the more I did it, the more I disliked it. It is a lot of waiting for certain levels to be hit before doing anything and doing it full-time was getting a bit boring. So I started to help out an old friend who is a plumber/electrician, but carrying on trading on the side. I really enjoyed being creative and started doing projects for myself. Over the past few years I have done several bathrooms, kitchens, patios and driveways. I really enjoy the creative and problem solving side of it and I get to learn new skills on the job all the time.",
